# ICAPS 2024 Previously Published Papers Track

The program committee of the 34th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) invites submissions of published papers for the Previously Published Research Track.

The track is designed to provide a forum to discuss important results related to automated planning and scheduling that appeared recently (from January 2023 onwards) in selective journals or conferences, but have not been previously presented at ICAPS (e.g., in venues such as JAIR, AIJ, AAAI, ECAI, IJCAI, etc.).

The goal of this track is twofold:

1. To provide authors an opportunity to present at the conference important results relevant to planning and scheduling published elsewhere. Papers that differ from traditional ICAPS format and topics are welcome.
2. To broaden the program with lines of work at the intersection between planning/scheduling and related fields such as, for example, constraint programming, operations research, control, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, multi-agent systems, robotics, transportation, computer games, and cognitive science. Papers that use planning and scheduling in some innovative way (even if they do not advance the planning technology itself) are also welcome.o broaden the program with lines of work at the intersection between planning/scheduling and related fields such as, for example, constraint programming, operations research, control, knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning, multi-agent systems, robotics, transportation, computer games, and cognitive science. Papers that use planning and scheduling in some innovative way (even if they do not advance the planning technology itself) are also welcome.

## Paper Presentation

All accepted presentations will be presented orally during the conference – at least one author is expected to register to ICAPS 2024 and to present the paper. Complete citations, abstracts and URLs of the original papers (if available from the publisher) will be published on the ICAPS 2024 web site as a permanent reference. This is a non-archival track, and so no copyright will be transferred for accepted papers.

## Submission Requirements

Submissions must meet the following criteria:

* Candidate papers must be published in either (1) a journal such as (but not limited to) AIJ, JAIR, EJOR, AURO, JAAMAS, KER and other leading journals relevant to each research area; or (2) a conference such as IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI, etc.
* Papers should have been published from January 2023 until the submission deadline.
* Papers that are in press may be submitted as long as the final camera-ready version is available.
* Submissions will be reviewed based on the strength of the new content and how it complements the planned program for ICAPS 2024.

We expect to accept only a select number of submissions that complement the ICAPS 2024 program, and this is in no way a direct reflection of the quality of work. I.e., we may need to reject several high-quality works due to space and research relevance to the program.

## Submission Process

All submissions will be done via [this form](https://forms.gle/q8LHqhicJnGbo6g1A), and the requirements are listed there.

Submissions will go through an expedited selection process. Selection criteria include significance of the results, relevance to the planning and scheduling community, and alignment to the current program of accepted papers.

## Summary of Important Dates

* Submission deadline: **April 5, 2024**
* Notification of acceptance: **April 19, 2024**
* ICAPS main conference: June 1-6, 2024

The reference timezone for all deadlines is UTC-12 (AoE time). That is, as long as there is still some place Anywhere on Earth where the deadline has not yet passed, you are on time.
