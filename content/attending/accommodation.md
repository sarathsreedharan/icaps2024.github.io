In such cases we recommend sharing a room -- you can coordinate to find a roomate on the [Planning Slack Channel](https://slack.planning.domains/), #icaps24-shared-housing. Check AirBnB and hostels for other accommodations.

The town of Canmore is a 20 minute drive from Banff and is a nice place to stay. It has accommodation, some of which will be at a more reasonable price (it is also not in Banff National Park, which means some of the taxes do not apply). There is a regular bus service between Canmore and Banff.
