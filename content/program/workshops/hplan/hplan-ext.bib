  abstract  = {The complexity of modeling planning domains is a major obstacle for making automated planning techniques more accessible, raising the demand of tools for providing modeling assistance. In particular, tools that can automatically correct errors in a planning domain are of great importance. Previous works have devoted efforts to developing such approaches for correcting classical  (non-hierarchical) domains. However, no approaches exist for hierarchical planning, which is what we offer here. More specifically, our approach takes as input a flawed hierarchical domain together with a plan known to be a solution but actually contradicting the domain (due to errors in the domain) and outputs corrections to the domain that add \emph{missing} actions to the domain and make the plan a solution. The approach achieves this by compiling the problem of finding corrections as another hierarchical planning problem.},

  abstract  = {There are multiple formalisms describing hierarchical planning domain models, however many of them do not show semantics of some features such as empty decomposition methods and extensive constraints. In this short paper we describe the semantics of a hierarchical domain model with these extensive constraints and show how empty decomposition methods would work within it. We also compare this model with other models and present some transformations of model properties.},
