# ICAPS Code of Conduct</h1>

It is against the
[ICAPS Code of Conduct](https://www.icaps-conference.org/index.php/Main/CodeOfConduct)
to engage in discriminatory harassment against individuals
participating at ICAPS. If you have been harassed or disparaged in
violation of the
[ICAPS Code of Conduct](https://www.icaps-conference.org/icaps-code-of-conduct/), please report
the incident through the [ICAPS Incident Report Form](https://incident-report.icaps-conference.org/).

If you would like to reach out to someone directly, you can reach out to one of the two official advocates for ICAPS 2024 --
[Jonathan Schaeffer](mailto:jonathan@ualberta.ca) and [Iman Awaad](mailto:iman.awaad@h-brs.de) -- or the ICAPS Inclusion Chair, [Shirin Sohrabi](mailto:ssohrab@us.ibm.com).
