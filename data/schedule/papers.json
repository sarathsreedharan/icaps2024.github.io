However, domains as specified in PDDL cannot fully capture the intuitive understanding of a planning domain.

A minor extension makes it possible to express all properties that can be determined in polynomial time. We demonstrate the suitability of the approach on established domains from the International Planning Competition.",

We differentiate between two kinds of repetitions and solve for one by integer linear programming and the other by search. Additionally, we characterize the differences between propositional planning and $\\mathrm{NAP}$ regarding these two kinds. To achieve this, we define so-called multi-valued partial order plans, a novel compact plan representation. Finally, we consider decidable fragments of $\\mathrm{NAP}$ and their complexity.",

Current ML approaches to MAPF have proposed methods that have started to scratch the surface of this potential. However, state-of-the-art ML approaches produce \"local\" policies that only plan for a single timestep and have poor success rates and scalability. Our main idea is that we can improve a ML local policy by using heuristic search methods on the output probability distribution to resolve deadlocks and enable full horizon planning. We show several model-agnostic ways to use heuristic search with ML that significantly improves the local ML policy's success rate and scalability. \nTo our best knowledge, we demonstrate the first time ML-based MAPF approaches have scaled to similar high congestion (e.g. 40% agent density) as state-of-the-art heuristic search methods.",

We also investigate how the warehouse structure itself affects MAPF performance. Based on our experimental analysis, we find that a fast low-level search is critical for 3D MAPF, EECBS's suboptimality significantly changes the effect of certain CBS techniques, and certain warehouse designs can noticeably influence MAPF scalability and speed.",

                "abstract": "In applications of Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), it is often the sum of planning and execution times \nthat needs to be minimised (i.e., the em Goal Achievement Time). Yet current methods seldom optimise for this objective. \nOptimal algorithms reduce execution time, but may require exponential planning time. Non-optimal algorithms reduce planning time, but at the expense of increased path length. To address these limitations we introduce PIE (Planning and Improving while Executing), a new framework for concurrent planning and execution in MAPF. We show how different instantiations of PIE affect practical performance, including initial planning time, action commitment time and concurrent vs. sequential planning and execution. We then adapt PIE to Lifelong MAPF, a popular application setting where agents are continuously assigned new goals and where additional decisions are required to ensure feasibility. We examine a variety of different approaches to overcome these challenges and we conduct comparative experiments vs. recently proposed alternatives. Results show that PIE substantially outperforms existing methods for One-shot and Lifelong MAPF.",

                "abstract": "The development of online applications for services such as package delivery, crowdsourcing, or taxi dispatching has caught the attention of the research community to the domain of online multi-agent multi-task allocation. In online service applications, tasks (or requests) to be performed arrive over time and need to be dynamically assigned to agents. Such planning problems are challenging because: (i) few or almost no information about future tasks is available for long-term reasoning; (ii) agent number, as well as, task number can be impressively high; and (iii) an efficient solution has to be reached in a limited amount of time. In this paper, we propose SKATE, a successive rank-based task assignment algorithm for online multi-agent planning. SKATE can be seen as a meta-heuristic approach which successively assigns a task to the best-ranked agent until all tasks have been assigned. We assessed the complexity of SKATE and showed it is cubic in the number of agents and tasks. To investigate how multi-agent multi-task assignment algorithms perform under a high number of agents and tasks, we compare three multi-task assignment methods in synthetic and real data benchmark environments: Integer Linear Programming (ILP), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and SKATE. In addition, a proactive approach is nested to all methods to determine near-future available agents (resources) using a receding-horizon. Based on the results obtained, we can argue that the classical ILP offers the better quality solutions when treating a low number of agents and tasks, i.e. low load despite the receding-horizon size, while it struggles to respect the time constraint for high load. SKATE performs better than the other methods in high load conditions, and even better when a variable receding-horizon is used.",

                "abstract": "Complex planning and scheduling problems have long been solved using various optimization or heuristic approaches. In recent year, imitation learning that aims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable alternative in solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning is designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the behavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in imitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation primarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the vehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is governed not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints. For instance, decisions on self-driving delivery vehicles are dependent not only on the route preferences/rewards (depending on past demand data) but also on the fuel in the vehicle and the time available. In such problems, imitation learning is challenging as decisions are not only dictated by the reward model but are also dependent on a cost constraint model. In this paper, we provide multiple methods that match expert distributions in the presence of trajectory cost constraints through: (a) Lagrangian-based method; (b) Meta-gradients to find a good trade-off between expected return and minimizing constraint violation; and (c) Cost-violation-based alternating gradient. We empirically show that leading imitation learning approaches imitate cost-constrained behaviors poorly and show that our meta-gradient-based approach achieves the best performance.",

Current planning methods heavily depend on expert knowledge to formulate solutions for specific cases and are therefore hardly generalized to new scenarios, on which Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) draws significant attention. Despite some successful applications in multi-agent decision-making tasks, MARL is hard to be scaled to a large number of agents. This paper rethinks the curse of agents in the centralized-training-decentralized-execution paradigm and proposes a local-critic approach to address the issue. By combining the local critic with the PPO algorithm, we design a deep MARL algorithm denoted as Local Critic PPO (LCPPO). In experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of LCPPO on a complex railway network benchmark, Flatland, with various numbers of agents. Noticeably, LCPPO shows prominent generalizability and robustness under the changes of environments.",

However, learning an effective policy often requires a large number of environment interactions. To mitigate sample complexity issues, recent approaches have used high-level task specifications, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTLf ) formulas or Reward Machines (RM), to guide the learning progress of the agent. In this work, we propose a novel approach, called Logical Specifications-guided Dynamic Task Sampling (LSTS), that learns a set of RL policies to guide an agent from an initial state to a goal state based on a high-level task specification, while minimizing the number of environmental interactions. Unlike previous work, LSTS does not assume information about the environment dynamics or the Reward Machine, and dynamically samples promising tasks that lead to successful goal policies. We evaluate LSTS on a gridworld and show that it achieves improved time-to-threshold performance on complex sequential decision-making problems compared to state-of-the-art RM and Automaton-guided RL baselines, such as Q-Learning for Reward Machines and Compositional RL from logical Specifications (DIRL). Moreover, we demonstrate that our method outperforms RM and Automaton-guided RL baselines in terms of sample-efficiency, both in a partially observable robotic task and in a continuous control robotic manipulation task.",

Nonetheless, the performance of ALNS relies on the proper configuration of its selection and acceptance parameters, which is known to be a complex and resource-intensive task. To address this, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approach called DR-ALNS that selects operators, adjusts parameters, and controls the acceptance criterion throughout the search. The proposed method aims to learn, based on the state of the search, to configure ALNS for the next iteration to yield more effective solutions for the given optimization problem. We evaluate the proposed method on an orienteering problem with stochastic weights and time windows, as presented in an IJCAI competition. The results show that our approach outperforms vanilla ALNS, ALNS tuned with Bayesian optimization, and two state-of-the-art DRL approaches that were the winning methods of the competition, achieving this with significantly fewer training observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate several good properties of the proposed DR-ALNS method: it is easily adapted to solve different routing problems, its learned policies perform consistently well across various instance sizes, and these policies can be directly applied to different problem variants.

Probabilistic inference conditioned by the observed traces allows our approach to derive a posterior probability of an atom being a precondition and/or an effect of an operator. Planning domains are obtained either by sampling or by applying the maximum a posteriori criterion. We compare our approach with a frequentist baseline and the currently available state-of-the-art approaches. We measure the performance of each method according to two criteria: reconstruction of the original planning domain and effectiveness in solving new planning problems of the same domain. Our experimental analysis shows that our approach learns action models that are more accurate w.r.t. state-of-the-art approaches, and strongly outperforms other approaches in generating models that are effective for solving new problems.",

Their inherent invariance under symmetries of the input graphs endows them with superior generalization capabilities compared to their symmetry-oblivious counterparts. However, this comes at the cost of limited expressive power. Notably, it is known that GNNs cannot distinguish between graphs that satisfy identical sentences of C$_2$ logic.\n    \nTo leverage GNNs for learning policies in PDDL domains, one needs to encode the contextual representation of the planning states as graphs. The effectiveness of this encoding, coupled with a specific GNN architecture, hinges on the absence of indistinguishable states necessitating distinct actions. This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical and statistical exploration of such situations in PDDL domains across diverse natural encoding schemes and GNN models.",

However, current approaches for learning heuristics have yet to achieve competitive performance against domain-independent heuristics in several domains, and have poor overall performance. In this work, we construct novel graph representations of lifted planning tasks and use the WL algorithm to generate features from them. These features are used with classical machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Processes, which are both fast to train and evaluate. Our novel approach, WL-GOOSE, reliably learns heuristics from scratch and outperforms the $h^{\\text{FF}}$ heuristic. It also outperforms or ties with LAMA on 4 out of 10 domains. To our knowledge, the WL-GOOSE learned heuristics are the first to achieve these feats.

However, such methods either assume a predetermined goal or assume that goals will be given as fully-specified states. Therefore, specifying a set of goal states is not possible for learned heuristic functions while, on the other hand, the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) allows for the specification of goal states using ground atoms in first-order logic. To address this issue, we introduce a method of training a heuristic function that estimates the distance between a given state and a set of goal states represented as a set of ground atoms in first-order logic. Furthermore, to allow for more expressive goal specification, we introduce techniques for specifying goals as answer set programs and using answer set solvers to discover sets of ground atoms that meet the specified goals. In our experiments with the Rubik's cube, sliding tile puzzles, and Sokoban, we show that we can specify and reach different goals without any need to re-train the heuristic function.",

Working in such practical settings with unknown (and non-stationary) transition systems and changing tasks, the proposed framework models gaps in the agent's current state of knowledge and uses them to conduct focused, investigative explorations. Data collected using these explorations is used for learning generalizable probabilistic models for solving the current task despite continual changes in the environment dynamics. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark domains show that this approach significantly outperforms planning and RL baselines in terms of sample complexity in non-stationary settings.

Studying whether the effects of an action can be undone by a sequence of other actions, that is, action reversibility, is beneficial, for example, in determining whether an action is safe to apply. This paper deals with action reversibility of non-deterministic actions, i.e. actions whose application might result in different outcomes. Inspired by the established notions of weak and strong plans in non-deterministic (or FOND) planning, we define the notions of weak and strong reversibility for non-deterministic actions. We then focus on the universality and uniformity of action reversibility, that is, whether we can always undo all possible effects of the action by the same means (i.e. policy), or whether some of the effects can never be undone. We show how these classes of problems can be solved via classical or FOND planning and evaluate our approaches on FOND benchmark domains.",

Recently, a generalized framework for weighted directed graphs was suggested, where edge-weight can be computed (estimated) multiple times, at increasing accuracy and run-time expense. We build on this framework to introduce the problem of finding the tightest admissible shortest path (TASP); a path with the tightest suboptimality bound on the optimal cost. This is a generalization of the shortest path problem to bounded uncertainty, where edge-weight uncertainty can be traded for computational cost.

Abstraction heuristics are well studied in planning formalisms without conditional effects such as SAS$^+$. However, conditional effects are crucial to model many planning tasks compactly. In this paper, we focus on *factored* tasks which allow a specific form of conditional effect, where effects on variable $x$ can only depend on the value of $x$. We generalize  projections, domain abstractions, Cartesian abstractions and the counterexample-guided abstraction refinement method to this formalism. While merge-and-shrink already covers factored task in theory, we provide an implementation that does so. In our experiments, we compare these abstraction-based heuristics to other heuristics supporting conditional effects, as well as symbolic search. On our new benchmark set of factored tasks, pattern database heuristics solve the most problems, followed by symbolic approaches on par with domain abstractions. The more general Cartesian abstractions fall behind in terms of coverage but usually solve problems the fastest among all tested approaches.

For (a), we propose two compilations that encode each\nconjunction explicitly as a new fact so that we can compute\npotentials over conjunctions in the original task as one-dimensional\npotentials in the compilation.\nRegarding (b), we provide evidence that informativeness of potential\nheuristics can be significantly increased with a small set of conjunctions,\nand these improvements have positive impact on the number of solved tasks.",

Transition landmarks dominate operator landmarks in theory but require solving a linear program that is prohibitively large in practice. We compare different approximations that replace transition-counting variables with more compact operator-counting variables. These are based on projections to operator landmarks and further relaxations. For one important special case, we show that the projection is lossless even for integer-valued variables.

                "abstract": "Grid-based path planning is one of the familiar issues in AI, and a popular topic in application areas such as computer games and robotics. Compressed Path Databases (CPDs) are recognized as a state-of-the-art method for grid-based path planning. It is able to find an optimal path extremely fast without a state-space search. In recent years, researchers tend to focus on improving CPDs from reducing CPD size or improving lookup performance. Among various methods, proximity wildcards is one of the most proven improvements in reducing the size of CPD. However, its proximity area is significantly restricted by complex terrain, which has more significant impacts on pathfinding efficiency and generates more additional costs. In this paper we enhance CPDs from the perspective of improving search efficiency and reducing search costs. Our work is to break the limitation between length and width of the proximity area, and adopt more flexible approaches to avoid obstacles, so as to reduce its impact on the proximity area and improve the search efficiency. Experiments performed on the benchmarks from Grid-Based Path Planning Competition (GPPC) demonstrate that the two proposed methods can effectively improve search efficiency and reduce the search costs by 2-3 orders of magnitude. Remark\u0002ably, our methods can further reduce storage costs, and improve compression capability of CPDs simultaneously.",

For each category, we articulate the issues considered and existing gaps. A critical insight resulting from our review is that the true potential of LLMs unfolds when they are integrated with traditional symbolic planners, pointing towards a promising neuro-symbolic approach. This approach effectively combines the generative aspects of LLMs with the precision of classical planning methods. By synthesizing insights from existing literature, we underline the potential of this integration to address complex planning challenges. Our goal is to encourage the ICAPS community to recognize the complementary strengths of LLMs and symbolic planners, advocating for a direction in automated planning that leverages these synergistic capabilities to develop more advanced and intelligent planning systems.",

                "abstract": "Semantic reasoning and dynamic planning capabilities are crucial for an autonomous agent to perform complex navigation tasks in unknown environments. It requires a large amount of common-sense knowledge, that humans possess, to succeed in these tasks. We present SayNav, a new approach that leverages human knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) for efficient generalization to complex navigation tasks in unknown large-scale environments. SayNav uses a novel grounding mechanism, that incrementally builds a 3D scene graph of the explored environment as inputs to LLMs, for generating feasible and contextually appropriate high-level plans for navigation. The LLM-generated plan is then executed by a pre-trained low-level planner, that treats each planned step as a short-distance point-goal navigation sub-task. SayNav dynamically generates step-by-step instructions during navigation and continuously refines future steps based on newly perceived information. We evaluate SayNav on multi-object navigation (MultiON) task, that requires the agent to utilize a massive amount of human knowledge to efficiently search multiple different objects in an unknown environment. We also introduce a benchmark dataset for MultiON task employing ProcTHOR framework that provides large photo-realistic indoor environments with variety of objects. SayNav achieves state-of-the-art results and even outperforms an oracle based baseline with strong ground-truth assumptions by more than 8\\% in terms of success rate, highlighting its ability to generate dynamic plans for successfully locating objects in large-scale new environments.",

                "abstract": "Task planning systems have been developed to help robots use human knowledge (about actions) to complete long-horizon tasks. Most of them have been developed for \u201cclosed worlds\u201d while assuming the robot is provided with complete world knowledge. However, the real world is generally open, and the robots frequently encounter unforeseen situations that can potentially break theplanner\u2019s completeness. Could we leverage the recent advances on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable classical planning systems to deal with novel situations? This paper introduces a novel framework, called COWP, for open-world task planning and situation handling. COWP dynamically augments the robot\u2019s action knowledge, including the preconditions and effects of actions, with task-oriented commonsense knowledge. COWP embraces the openness from LLMs, and is grounded to specific domains via action knowledge. For systematic evaluations, we collected a dataset that includes 1085 execution-time situations. Each situation corresponds to a state instance wherein a robot is potentially unable to complete a task using a solution that normally works. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms competitive baselines from the literature in the success rate of service tasks. Additionally, we have demonstrated COWP using a mobile manipulator. Supplementary materials are available at: https://cowplanning.github.io/",

Several studies showed that deep learning models using these architectures not only possess a remarkable linguistic knowledge, but they also exhibit forms of factual knowledge, common sense, and even programming skills. However, the scientific community still debates about their reasoning capabilities, which have been recently tested in the context of automated AI planning; the literature presents mixed results, and the prevailing view is that current transformer-based models may not be adequate for planning.\nIn this paper, we addresses this challenge differently. We introduce a GPT-based model customised for planning (PlanGPT) to learn a general policy for classical planning by training the model from scratch with a dataset of solved planning instances.  Once PlanGPT has been trained for a domain, it can be used to generate a solution plan for an input problem instance in that domain. Our training procedure exploits automated planning knowledge to enhance the performance of the trained model. We build and evaluate our GPT model with several planning domains, and we compare its performance w.r.t. other recent deep learning techniques for generalised planning, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Thus far however, PPA does not permit applicability filtering, which is challenging due to the additional constraints that need to be taken into account. Here we overcome that limitation, through a range of algorithmic enhancements. In our experiments, our enhancements achieve several orders of magnitude speed-up over a baseline implementation, bringing PPA with applicability filtering close to the performance of PPA without such filtering.",

The high-dimensional composite state space renders many well-known motion planning algorithms intractable.\nRecently, multi-agent path finding (MAPF) algorithms have shown promise in discrete 2D domains, providing rigorous guarantees. However, widely used conflict-based methods in MAPF assume an efficient single-agent motion planner. This poses challenges in adapting them to manipulation cases where this assumption does not hold, due to the high dimensionality of configuration spaces and the computational bottlenecks associated with collision checking.\nTo this end, we propose an approach for accelerating conflict-based search algorithms by leveraging their repetitive and incremental nature -- making them tractable for use in complex scenarios involving multi-arm coordination in obstacle-laden environments. \nWe show that our method preserves completeness and bounded sub-optimality guarantees, and demonstrate its practical efficacy through a set of experiments with up to 10 robotic arms.",

Using motion planners for testing the feasibility of task plans and filling out the details is not effective because it makes the geometrical constraints play a passive role. This work introduces a new interleaved approach for integrating the two dimensions of TAMP that makes use of sketches, a recent simple but powerful language for expressing the decomposition of problems into subproblems. A sketch has width 1 if it decomposes the problem into subproblems that can be solved greedily in linear time. In the paper, a general sketch is introduced for several classes of TAMP problems which has width 1 under suitable assumptions. While sketch decompositions have been developed for classical planning, they offer two important benefits in the context of TAMP. First, when a task plan is found to be unfeasible due to the geometric constraints, the combinatorial search resumes in a specific subproblem. Second, the sampling of object configurations is not done once, globally, at the start of the search, but locally, at the start of each subproblem. Optimizations of this basic setting are also considered and experimental results over existing and new pick-and-place benchmarks are reported.",

To this end, we aim to enable easy gait specification and efficient policy learning. Leveraging Reward Machines (RMs) for high-level gait specification over foot contacts, our approach is called RM-based Locomotion Learning (RMLL), and supports adjusting gait frequency at execution time. Gait specification is enabled through the use of a few logical rules per gait (e.g., alternate between moving front feet and back feet) and does not require labor-intensive motion priors. Experimental results in simulation highlight the diversity of learned gaits (including two novel gaits), their energy consumption and stability across different terrains, and the superior sample-efficiency when compared to baselines.

Our framework not only enhances area coverage and optimizes task performance, particularly in terms of makespan, for workspaces rich in irregular obstacles but also addresses the challenges of path continuity and curvature critical for non-holonomic robots by generating smooth paths without decomposing the workspace. MCFS solves MCPP by constructing a graph of isolines and transforming MCPP into a combinatorial optimization problem, aiming to minimize the makespan while covering all vertices. \nOur contributions include developing a unified CFS version for scalable and adaptable MCPP, extending it to MCPP with novel optimization techniques for cost reduction and path continuity and smoothness, and demonstrating through extensive experiments that MCFS outperforms existing MCPP methods in makespan, path curvature, coverage ratio, and overlapping ratio. Our research marks a significant step in MCPP, showcasing the fusion of computer graphics and automated planning principles to advance the capabilities of multi-robot systems in complex environments.",

                "abstract": "Solving a Task-and-Motion Planning (TAMP) problem can be represented as a sequential (meta-) decision process, where early decisions concern the skeleton (sequence of logic actions) and later decisions concern what to compute for such skeletons (e.g., action parameters, bounds, RRT paths, or full optimal manipulation trajectories). We consider the general problem of how to schedule compute effort in such hierarchical solution processes. More specifically, we introduce infinite completion trees as a problem formalization, where before we can expand or evaluate a node, we have to solve a preemptible computational sub-problem of a priori unknown compute effort. Infinite branchings represent an infinite choice of random initializations of computational sub-problems. Decision making in such trees means to decide on where to invest compute or where to widen a branch. We propose a heuristic to balance branching width and compute depth using polynomial level sets. We show completeness of the resulting solver and that a round robin baseline strategy used previously for TAMP becomes a special case. Experiments confirm the robustness and efficiency of the method on problems including stochastic bandits and a suite of TAMP problems, and compare our approach to a round robin baseline. An appendix comparing the framework to bandit methods and proposing a corresponding tree policy version is found on the supplementary webpage: https://www.user.tu-berlin.de/mtoussai/24-CompletionTrees/.",

To synthesise multi-robot behaviour that is robust to early announcements and unexpected delays, multi-robot task allocation methods must explicitly model the stochastic processes that govern task announcement. In this paper, we model task announcement using continuous-time Markov chains which predict when and where tasks will be announced. We then present a task allocation framework which uses the continuous-time Markov chains to allocate tasks proactively, such that robots are near or at the task location upon its announcement. Our method seeks to minimise the expected total waiting duration for each task, ie the duration between task announcement and a robot beginning to service the task. Our framework can be applied to any multi-robot task allocation problem where robots complete spatiotemporal tasks which are announced stochastically. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in simulation, where we outperform baselines which do not allocate tasks proactively, or do not fully exploit our task announcement models.",

While CBS- TA finds optimal solutions, it faces scalability challenges due to the duplicated collision resolution in multiple trees and the expensive computation of K-best assignments. We introduce Incremental Target Assignment CBS (ITA-CBS) to bypass these two computational bottlenecks. ITA-CBS generates only a single search tree and avoids computing K-best assignments by incrementally computing new 1-best assignments during the search.

Enceladus in particular is unique among the icy moons because there are known vent systems that are likely connected to a subsurface ocean, through which the ocean water is ejected to space. An existing study has shown that sending small robots into the vents and directly sampling the ocean water is likely possible. To enable such a mission, NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is developing a snake-like robot called Exobiology Extant Life Surveyor (EELS) that can navigate Enceladus\u2019 extreme surface and descend an erupting vent to capture unaltered liquid samples and potentially reach the ocean. However, navigating to and through Enceladus\u2019 environment is challenging: Because of the limitations of existing orbital reconnaissance, there is substantial uncertainty with respect to its geometry and the physical properties of the surface/vents; communication is limited, which requires highly autonomous robots to execute the mission with limited human supervision. Here, we provide an overview of the EELS project and its development effort to create a risk-aware autonomous robot to navigate these extreme ice terrains/environments. We describe the robot\u2019s architecture and the technical challenges to navigate and sense the icy environment safely and effectively. We focus on the challenges related to surface mobility, task and motion planning under uncertainty, and risk quantification.

The ability to compose long-horizon tasks based on unconstrained language instructions necessitates the acquisition of a diverse set of general-purpose skills.However, acquiring inherent primitive skills in a coupled and long-horizon environment without external rewards or human supervision presents significant challenges. In this paper, we evaluate the relationship between skills and language instructions from a mathematical perspective, employing two forms of mutual information within the framework of language-conditioned policy learning.To maximize the mutual information between language and skills in an unsupervised manner, we propose an end-to-end imitation learning approach known as Language Conditioned Skill Discovery (LCSD). Specifically, we utilize vector quantization to learn discrete latent skills and leverage skill sequences of trajectories to reconstruct high-level semantic instructions.Through extensive experiments on language-conditioned robotic navigation and manipulation tasks, encompassing BabyAI, LORel, and Calvin, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over prior works. Our approach exhibits enhanced generalization capabilities towards unseen tasks, improved skill interpretability, and notably higher rates of task completion success.",

Centralized approaches to observation scheduling rely on a single controller planning the actions of each satellite. With increasing on-board capability for autonomy, we can view the constellation as a multi-agent system (MAS) and employ decentralized scheduling solutions. We formulate the problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) and desire limited inter-agent communication. Due to the scale and structure of the problem, existing DCOP algorithms are inadequate for this application. We develop a scheduling approach that employs a well-coordinated heuristic to decompose the global DCOP into sub-problems as to enable the application of DCOP algorithms. Building on previous work, we present the Neighborhood Stochastic Search (NSS) algorithm, a decentralized algorithm to effectively solve the Earth observing multi-satellite constellation scheduling problem. In this paper, we identify the roadblocks of deploying DCOP solvers to a large-scale, real-world problem, propose a decomposition-based scheduling approach that is effective at tackling large scale DCOPs, empirically evaluate the approach against other baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness, and discuss the generality of the approach.",

Since most of these scenarios are over-constrained, optimal solutions do not always satisfy all agents.

We propose CMAOE, a domain-independent approach to obtain contrastive explanations by: (i) generating a new solution S\u2032 where property P is enforced, while also minimizing the differences between S and S\u2032; and (ii) highlighting the differences between the two solutions, with respect to the features of the objective function of the multi-agent system. Such explanations aim to help agents understanding why the initial solution is better in the context of the multi-agent system than what they expected. We have carried out a computational evaluation that shows that CMAOE can generate contrastive explanations for large multi-agent optimization problems. We\nhave also performed an extensive user study in four different domains that shows that: (i) after being presented with these explanations, humans\u2019 satisfaction with the original solution increases; and (ii) the constrastive explanations generated by CMAOE are preferred or equally preferred by humans over the ones generated by state of the art approaches.",

However, the reactive structure of their solution policies is typically not easily comprehensible by an end-user, while planners neither justify the reasons behind their choice of a particular policy over others. To strengthen confidence in the planner's decision-making, recent work in classical planning has introduced a framework for explaining to the user the possible solution space in terms of necessary trade-offs between user-provided plan properties. Here, we extend this framework to SSPs. We introduce a notion of policy properties taking into account action-outcome uncertainty. We analyze formally the computational problem of identifying the exclusion relationships between policy properties, showing that this problem is in fact harder than SSP planning in a complexity theoretical sense. We show that all the relationships can be identified through a series of heuristic searches, which, if ordered in a clever way, yields an anytime algorithm. Further, we introduce an alternative method, which leverages a connection to multi-objective probabilistic planning to move all the computational burden to a pre-process. Finally, we explore empirically the feasibility of the proposed explanation methodology on a range of adapted IPPC benchmarks.",

Where human-AI interaction is concerned, such knowledge may be inconsistent with the ground truth, resulting in the AI agent not meeting its expectations and degraded team performance. Explicable planning was previously introduced as a novel planning approach to reconciling human expectations and the agent\u2019s optimal behavior for more interpretable decision-making. One critical issue that remains unaddressed is safety in explicable planning since it can lead to explicable behaviors that are unsafe. We propose Safe Explicable Planning (SEP) to extend the prior work to support the specification of a safety bound. The objective of SEP is to search for behaviors that are close to the human\u2019s expectations while satisfying the bound on the agent\u2019s return, the safety criterion chosen in this work. We show that the problem generalizes the consideration of multiple objectives to multiple models and our formulation introduces a Pareto set. Under such a formulation, we propose a novel exact method that returns the Pareto set of safe explicable policies, a more efficient greedy method that returns one of the Pareto optimal policies, and approximate solutions for them based on the aggregation of states to further scalability. Formal proofs are provided to validate the desired theoretical properties of the exact and greedy methods. We evaluate our methods both in simulation and with physical robot experiments. Results confirm the validity and efficacy of our methods for safe explicable planning.",

Recently, situated temporal planning was introduced, where planning starts at time 0, and execution occurs after planning terminates. Situated temporal planning reflects a more realistic scenario where planning is online. However, in situated temporal planning a complete plan must be generated before any action is executed. In some problems with extreme time pressure, timing is too tight to complete planning before the first action must be executed. For example, an autonomous car which has a truck backing towards it should probably move out of the way now, and plan how to get to its destination later.\nIn this paper, we propose a new problem, called concurrent planning and execution, in which actions can be dispatched (executed) before planning terminates.  Unlike previous settings, we must handle wall clock deadlines that affect action applicability and goal achievement (as in situated planning) while also supporting dispatching actions before a complete plan has been found.  We extend previous work on metareasoning for situated temporal planning to develop an algorithm for this new setting. Our empirical evaluation shows that when there is extreme time pressure, our approach outperforms situated temporal planning.",

Although hierarchical learning and state abstraction methods have been explored over the past decades, explicit methods to build useful abstractions of models are rarely provided. In this work, we provide a new state abstraction method for solving infinite horizon problems in the discounted and total settings. Our approach is to progressively disaggregate abstract regions by iteratively slicing aggregations of states relatively to a value function. The distinguishing feature of our method, in contrast to previous approximations of the Bellman operator, is the disaggregation of regions during value function iterations (or policy evaluation steps). The objective is to find a more efficient aggregation that reduces the error on each piece of the partition. We provide a proof of convergence for this algorithm without making any assumptions about the structure of the problem. We also show that this process decreases the computational complexity of the Bellman operator iteration and provides useful abstractions. We then plug this state space disaggregation process in classical Dynamic Programming algorithm namely Approximate Value Iteration, Q-Value Iteration and Policy Iteration. Finally, we conduct a numerical comparison on randomly generated MDPs as well as classical MDPs. Those experiments show that our policy-based algorithm is faster than both traditional dynamic programming approach and recent aggregative methods that use a fixed number of adaptive partitions.",

Then, we focus on linear execution strategies, which resemble classical plans in that they follow a fixed sequence of actions. We show that any problem that can be solved by a linear execution strategy can be solved by a particular form of linear execution strategy which assigns wait-for preconditions to each action in the plan, that specifies when to execute that action. Then, we propose a sound algorithm that verifies a sequence of actions and assigns wait-for preconditions to them by leveraging abstraction.",

Existing systems rely on a single discretisation delta or, at most, two: a simulation delta to model the dynamics of the environment, and a planning delta, that is used to specify when decisions can be taken. However, there exist cases where this rigid schema is not ideal, for instance when agents with very different speeds need to cooperate or interact in a shared environment, and a more flexible approach that can accommodate more deltas is necessary.  To address the needs of this class of hybrid planning problems, in this paper we introduce a reformulation approach that allows the encapsulation of different levels of discretisation in PDDL+ models, hence allowing any domain-independent planning engine to reap the benefits. Further, we provide the community with a new set of benchmarks that highlights the limits of fixed discretisation.",

Recent work has explored the extension of replanning methods to the case of mixed discrete and continuous probabilistic domains by leveraging MILP compilations of the RDDL specification language.  Other recent advances in probabilistic planning have explored the compilation of structured mixed discrete and continuous RDDL domains into a determinized computation graph that also lends itself to replanning via so-called planning by backpropagation methods.  However, to date, there has not been any comprehensive comparison of these recent optimization-based replanning methodologies to the state-of-the-art winner of the discrete probabilistic IPC 2011 and 2014 and runner-up in 2018 (PROST) and the winner of the mixed discrete-continuous probabilistic IPC 2023 (DiSProd). In this paper, we provide JaxPlan that has several extensive upgrades to both planning by backpropagation and its compact tensorized compilation from RDDL to a Jax computation graph with discrete relaxations and a sample average approximation.  We also provide the first detailed overview of a compilation of the RDDL language specification to Gurobi's Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) solver that we term GurobiPlan.

While early approaches failed to outperform traditional CO solvers, the gap between handcrafted and learned heuristics has been steadily closing. However, most work in this area has focused on simple CO problems to benchmark new models and algorithms, leaving a gap in the development of methods specifically designed to handle more involved problems. Therefore, this work considers the problem of picker routing in the context of mixed-shelves warehouses, which involves not only a heterogeneous graph representation, but also a combinatorial action space resulting from the integrated selection and routing decisions to be made. We propose both a novel encoder to effectively learn representations of the heterogeneous graph and a hierarchical decoding scheme that exploits the combinatorial structure of the action space.

                "abstract": "Train routing is sensitive to delays that occur in the network. When a train is delayed, it is imperative that a new plan be found quickly, or else other trains may need to be stopped to ensure safety, potentially causing cascading delays. In this paper, we consider this class of multi-agent planning problems, which we call Multi-Agent Execution Delay Replanning. We show that these can be solved by reducing the problem to an any-start-time safe interval planning problem. When an agent has an any-start-time plan, it can react to a delay by simply looking up the precomputed plan for the delayed start time. We identify crucial real-world problem characteristics like the agent's speed, size, and safety envelope, and extend the any-start-time planning to account for them. Experimental results on real-world train networks show that any-start-time plans are compact and can be computed in reasonable time while enabling agents to instantly recover a safe plan.",

                "abstract": "Classical planning problems are defined using some specification language, such as PDDL. The domain expert defines action schemas, objects, the initial state, and the goal. One key aspect of PDDL is that the set of objects cannot be modified during plan execution. While this is fine in many domains, sometimes it makes the modeling much more complicated. This not only impacts the performance of the planners, but it also requires the domain expert to bound the number of required objects beforehand, which might be an intractable problem by itself. Here, we introduce an extension to the classical planning formalism, where action effects can create and remove objects. This problem is semi-decidable, but it becomes decidable if we can bound the number of objects at any given state, even though the state-space is still infinite. On the practical side, we extend the Powerlifted planning system to support this PDDL extension. Our results show that Powerlifted does not lose efficiency by supporting this extension while allowing for easier PDDL models.",

Decoupled search is an approach that automatically decomposes planning tasks based on their causal structure, often significantly reducing the search effort. However, its broad applicability is limited by the need for specialized algorithms. In this paper, we present an approach that embodies decoupled search for non-optimal planning through a novel task transformation. Specifically, given a task and a decomposition, we create a transformed task such that the state space of the transformed task is isomorphic to that of decoupled search on the original task. This eliminates the need for specialized algorithms and allows the use of various planning technology in the decoupled-search framework. Empirical evaluation shows that our method is empirically competitive with specialized decoupled algorithms and favorable to other related problem reformulation techniques.",

In this work, we consider three extensions of this basic language aimed at making policies and sketches more flexible and reusable: internal memory states, as in finite state con- trollers indexical features, whose values are a function of the state and a number of internal registers that can be loaded with objects; and modules that wrap up policies and sketches and allow them to call each other by passing parameters. In addition, unlike general policies that select actions indirectly by selecting state transitions, the new language allows for the selection of ground actions directly. The expressive power of the resulting language for recombining policies and sketches is illustrated through a number of examples. The problem of learning policies and sketches in the new language, from the bottom up, is left for future work.",

The system\u2019s features include visualising plan components, and their relationships, identifying plan conflicts, and examples applied to real-world problems.

Specifically, a sender, who can perfectly observe the state of a dynamic environment but cannot take actions, aims to persuade an uninformed, far-sighted receiver to take actions to maximize the long-term utility of the sender, by sending messages. After receiving a message, the self-interested receiver derives a posterior belief and takes an action. The immediate reward of each player can be unaligned, thus the sender needs to ensure persuasiveness when designing the messaging scheme.\n\nWe formulate this problem as a bi-linear program and show that there exist infinitely many non-trivial persuasive messaging schemes for any problem instance. Moreover, we show that when the sender uses a k-memory messaging scheme, the optimal strategy for the receiver is also a k-memory strategy. We propose a fast heuristic algorithm for this problem and show that it can be extended to the setting where the sender has threat ability. We experimentally evaluate our algorithm, comparing it with the solution obtained by the Gurobi solver, in terms of performance and running time. Extensive experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the solution in terms of running time, yet achieves comparable performance.",

                "abstract": "In the Weight-Constrained Shortest-Path (WCSP) problem, given a graph in which each edge is annotated with a cost and a weight, a start state, and a goal state, the task is to compute a minimum-cost path from the start state to the goal state with weight no larger than a specified weight limit. While most existing works have focused on solving the WCSP problem optimally, many real-world situations admit a trade-off between efficiency and a suboptimality bound for the path cost. In this paper, we propose a novel bounded suboptimal WCSP algorithm called WC-A\\*pex that is built on a state-of-the-art approximate bi-objective search algorithm called A\\*pex. WC-A\\*pex uses an efficient, albeit approximate, representation of paths with similar costs and weights to compute a (1 + \u03b5)-suboptimal path, for a user-specified \u03b5. During search, WC-A\\*pex avoids storing all paths explicitly and thereby reduces the search effort while still retaining its (1 + \u03b5)-suboptimality property. On benchmark instances that model road networks, our experimental results show that WC-A*pex with \u03b5 = 0.01 (i.e., with 1% suboptimality) achieves an order-of-magnitude speed-up over WC-A\\*, a state-of-the-art WCSP algorithm, and its bounded suboptimal variant.",

Existing approaches compute these states by searching forward either in the original or a reformulated task. In this paper, we propose several algorithms that use symbolic bidirectional search to efficiently compute centroids and minimum covering states. Experimental results in both existing and novel benchmarks show that our algorithms scale much better than previous approaches, establishing a new state of the art technique for this problem.",

In this work, we address one such gap by considering the question of whether UCT can exhibit lookahead pathology --- a paradoxical phenomenon first observed in Minimax search where greater search effort leads to worse decision-making. We introduce a novel family of synthetic games that offer rich modeling possibilities while remaining amenable to mathematical analysis. Our theoretical and experimental results suggest that UCT is indeed susceptible to pathological behavior in a range of games drawn from this family.",
